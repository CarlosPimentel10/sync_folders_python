# Folder Sync Python Program

This Python program provides a simple folder synchronization utility. It allows you to maintain an identical copy of a source folder in a replica folder. The program periodically checks for changes in the source folder and updates the replica accordingly.

## Features

- **Folder Synchronization:** Automatically copies or updates files from the source to the replica folder.
- **Log:** Logs synchronization activities, making it easy to track changes.
- **Customizable:** Adjust the time interval for synchronization as needed.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11
- [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) for running tests (optional)
